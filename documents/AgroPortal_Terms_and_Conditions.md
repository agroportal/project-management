# 🗽Terms & Conditions

**Version 1. March 2024. \n Authored by AgroPortal management and maintenance team**

# **AgroPortal Terms and Conditions (English)**

**Last updated March 15, 2024.**

## **General Introduction**

Many vocabularies and ontologies are produced to represent and annotate agri-food data. It is therefore necessary to have a common platform to identify, host, and enable their automatic use in agroinformatics applications. AgroPortal, accessible at __<https://agroportal.lirmm.fr>__, is a web portal of ontologies and vocabularies dedicated to the fields of agronomy, agriculture, and food. It provides a web application as well as an application programming interface (API) and a SPARQL endpoint. It relies on the generic and open technology OntoPortal (__<https://ontoportal.org>__) which is specialized for the agri-food domain. The ontology repository allows hosting, searching, versioning, visualization, exploration, commenting and proposing on ontologies; it also includes a semantic annotation service for text (Annotator) and an ontology recommendation service (Recommender) as well as a catalog of alignments between ontologies (Mapping). All within an infrastructure fully compatible with the semantic web. AgroPortal pays particular attention to meeting the requirements of the agri-food community.


Any use of the AgroPortal web application, or its API or SPARQL endpoint, is subject to compliance with these Terms and Conditions (T&C).

### Definitions

**AgroPortal**: The entire software – consisting of the web application, the programmatic interface and the SPARQL query interface – which offers services and functionalities for a defined set of ontologies and other semantic resources, mainly in the field of agronomy, agriculture, environment and food (agri-food).


**Content**: All data and information contained, hosted and served by AgroPortal. This mainly concerns the ontologies themselves (source files) and their metadata (catalogue records) but it also includes alignments between ontologies, projects, comments and proposals or any other form of aggregation of this content.


**Ontology**: Term used to cover all types of semantic resources or semantic artefacts hosted and served on AgroPortal: vocabulary, terminology, thesaurus, taxonomy, etc.


**Web application**: All web pages consumed on the client side and produced by the AgroPortal software on the server side, to carry out the services that the portal offers and implements. This concerns all web pages accessible from the address: __<https://agroportal.lirmm.fr>__


**Programmatic interface (API)**: All AgroPortal functionalities and services accessible via a structured and clearly specified interface allowing a computer program to automatically interact with the software. This concerns all web service calls invoked from the addresses: __<https://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/>__ and __<https://services.agroportal.lirmm.fr/>__


**SPARQL endpoint**: The interface allowing querying the AgroPortal software and its content via the SPARQL language. This concerns the query interface accessible to any user or program at the address: __<https://sparql.agroportal.lirmm.fr/>__


**User**: Any natural or legal person who accesses the AgroPortal ontology repository, directly or via a computer program, in order to consult, contribute or download content for reuse, including for purposes other than those for which this content was produced.


**Contributor**: Any user, natural or legal person, who has a “user account” on AgroPortal and is authorized to submit and document an ontology or any other form of content. A contributor can, for example, enter comments and proposals related to an ontology or its content. A contributor can be an “ontology administrator” if he/she has deposited it or if he/she has been granted this right.


**Curator**: Any contributor, natural or legal person, who ensures the curation of AgroPortal content by carrying out verification and harmonization of metadata and all other actions ensuring the quality of AgroPortal data. A curator can propose modifications to contributors to improve the quality of the ontologies or their metadata, in compliance with __[the Charter of metadata curators](https://doc.jonquetlab.lirmm.fr/share/e6158eda-c109-4385-852c-51a42de9a412/doc/metadata-guidelines-and-recommendations-pOFbK9sIfp)__. Any curator has administrative rights over all ontologies in the repository. This concerns all people in the “curator” group described here: __<https://github.com/orgs/agroportal/teams>__


**Administrator**: Any curator, natural or legal person, who, in addition to content curation, ensures the general administration of the portal: user management, addition/deletion of content, monitoring of the portal and development of additional functionalities. This concerns all people in the “developers” group described here: __<https://github.com/orgs/agroportal/teams>__


**Administrative authority**: Any public or private person responsible for a public service mission (article L. 300-2 of the public and administrative relations code, CRPA).


**Public information**: Information appearing in documents produced or received by administrative authorities, communicable to any person or having been the subject of public dissemination in accordance with articles L. 312-1 to L. 312-1-2 of the CRPA and over which third parties do not hold intellectual property rights (articles L. 321-1 et seq.).


**Reuse**: Use by any natural or legal person of AgroPortal ontologies or other content including for purposes other than those for which they were produced.

### Access rights

Using AgroPortal is free.


AgroPortal content is by default publicly accessible and open to any user. For ontologies and their metadata, there are nevertheless three levels of access rights:

* Public access with download of the source file (and versions) possible. The default mode.
* Public access without downloading the source file. This mode must be explicitly requested to an administrator.
* Private access reserved for a selection of contributors declared by the depositary of an ontology as well as curators and administrators. This access therefore requires a connection via a user account.

## Purpose and Functionalities

The AgroPortal ontology repository mainly allows:

* the discovery, browsing, search, viewing or downloading of ontologies and other content by users;
* the publication of ontologies or other content by contributors;
* management of content and the repository by curators and administrators.


All features are documented at the addresses:

* __<https://ontoportal.github.io/documentation/>__
* __<https://doc.jonquetlab.lirmm.fr/share/e6158eda-c109-4385-852c-51a42de9a412/doc/public-documentation-QMpsC9aVBb>__

### Discovery, consultation, search, viewing or downloading of ontologies and other content by users

AgroPortal provides ontologies published by contributors which can be accessed for download, or via the web application, the API or the SPARQL endpoint.


Consultation of the ontologies and metadata made available for public access on AgroPortal or their downloading does not require any connection or prior registration by users. Consulting and downloading private ontologies requires authentication. Not creating a user account does not affect consultation of publicly accessible resources on the repository. All users are required to respect the user license specific to each ontology.


Any user can participate in the quality control of AgroPortal by reporting, to the contact email address, in particular content not intended to appear there (illicit or contrary to the T&Cs).

### Publication of ontologies or other content by contributors

Any contributor can contribute to AgroPortal content, among other things, by publishing ontologies and documenting them with metadata. Any contributor can also modify or update content to which he or she has the rights (i.e., generally content previously posted). Removing content generally requires contacting an administrator.


To become a contributor, a user must register on AgroPortal by creating a personal account. For more details on user accounts, see the Privacy section of the T&Cs. After automatic account validation, the various features are immediately available. Administration rights to ontologies other than those deposited by a contributor must be assigned by another contributor who is an administrator of the ontology concerned or by an AgroPortal curator.

### Content and repository management by curators and administrators

Curators and administrators are associated users or members of the AgroPortal management and maintenance team. They are responsible as much as possible for controlling the quality and consistency of the repository’s content. The role of curator or administrator must be assigned by another curator or administrator from the management team.

## Code of Conduct and User Responsibilities

AgroPortal is not intended to disseminate advertising data, promotion of private interests, contrary to public order or, more generally, illicit. AgroPortal administrators may, if necessary, without notice, delete or make access to such data or content impossible.


AgroPortal encourages contributors to make the content they publish reliable and documented. Contributors update their content, in accordance with article L. 312-1-1 of the CRPA.

### Editorial line

AgroPortal's editorial line concerns content related, in the broad sense, to the fields of agronomy, agriculture, food and the environment. Generic ontologies or semantic web vocabularies can also be hosted for the sake of consistency and completeness of the service to users. Curators may not agree to host and serve ontologies that are not in the editorial line of AgroPortal. Users and contributors are encouraged to also turn to other actors and providers of the OntoPortal Alliance (__<https://ontoportal.org>__) who can provide similar ontology repositories with other editorial lines.

### Personal data

Ontologies and other content hosted on AgroPortal are not intended to contain personal data. Only registered accounts contain personal data (See Privacy).

### Data covered by intellectual property rights

Contributors are solely responsible for the ontologies or content they publish on AgroPortal.


When a contributor publishes an ontology including intellectual property rights that may hinder its reuse, he/she must mention these rights in the metadata of the ontology. It must then indicate the identity of the natural or legal person holding these rights or, if this is not known, the identity of the person from whom the ontology concerned was obtained.


When contributors submit an ontology, it is preferable that they themselves are authors, developers or contributors to this ontology. Otherwise, AgroPortal's curators may not agree to host and serve an ontology deposited by a non-author and for which AgroPortal has received a removal request from an original author or developer of the ontology concerned.

### Licenses

We distinguish the license which applies to a hosted ontology from the license which applies to the metadata of this ontology described in the AgroPortal catalog entry.

* The license of the ontology is indicated, as much as possible, by the contributor in the metadata. It must be in accordance with the level of accessibility chosen by the contributor for this ontology. In the absence of an explicitly specified license, an ontology publicly accessible on AgroPortal is considered by default as public and reusable and distributed under Open License (equivalent to CC-BY).
* The license that applies to the ontology metadata (publicly and privately accessible) described in the AgroPortal catalog entry is an Open License (equivalent to CC-BY). In the case of private ontologies, AgroPortal undertakes not to disseminate this information until the access right of the ontology is changed to “public”.


Ontologies containing non-public information are disseminated, where applicable, only after agreement from the third party rights holder or co-rights holder.

### Contact email address

AgroPortal’s contact email address to reach the management and maintenance team is __[agroportal-support@lirmm.fr](mailto:agroportal-support@lirmm.fr)__


The contact email address allows users to contact AgroPortal administrators for help or information on using the repository or its content. It is not intended to receive requests relating to the individual situation of a user in their relations with an administrative authority. It is also not a direct way to contact a contributor; To do this, users can turn to the contact information provided in the ontology metadata.

### User mailing list

The email address of the AgroPortal users and contributors mailing list is __[agroportal-users@lirmm.fr](mailto:agroportal-users@lirmm.fr)__


The user mailing list allows the AgroPortal management and maintenance team to contact contributors or other users to inform them of new features, information or any other news related to the use of AgroPortal. It is not intended to disseminate messages outside the subject of AgroPortal. It is also not a direct means of exchange between contributors or users.


The creation of a user account on AgroPortal is associated with automatic registration on the users' mailing list. Anyone may request removal from the mailing list at any time via the contact email address.

## Commitments and responsibilities

### Quality of service and service offered

Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the AgroPortal management and maintenance team strives to guarantee the availability and robustness of AgroPortal services. This applies to all AgroPortal software, whether accessed through its web application, its API or its SPARQL endpoint.


However, the AgroPortal management and maintenance team also reserves the right to develop, modify or suspend, without notice, the AgroPortal repository services for maintenance or for any other reason that it deems necessary. The unavailability of AgroPortal does not give rise to any compensation and cannot give rise to any prosecution.


AgroPortal undertakes to take all necessary precautions to preserve the integrity of the ontologies made available, and in particular to prevent their content from being distorted or subject to a specific interpretation. AgroPortal undertakes to follow, as far as possible, the standards of the semantic web community and in particular the W3C Recommendations.


For the sole purpose of guaranteeing a better service to users, and without ever distorting its meaning or value, curators reserve the possibility of modifying the metadata associated with an ontology.

### Responsibilities of AgroPortal

The AgroPortal management and maintenance team does not carry out a priori control over the content of contributors. As soon as AgroPortal becomes aware of illegal content or content that does not comply with the T&Cs, AgroPortal administrators act quickly to remove this content or make access to it impossible. A “Send Feedback” procedure is set up on AgroPortal and can be used to report content that does not comply with the T&Cs.


AgroPortal reserves the right to delete or make inaccessible, without notice:

* Contributions unrelated to the activity of the portal (see Editorial line), published for the purpose of hindering the proper functioning, advertising or promotion, propaganda or proselytism and any contribution contravening the laws and regulations in force;
* The personal account of a contributor, curator or administrator and to refuse that certain people have access to the portal in the event of a violation of the T&Cs.

### Textual and graphic content

The textual content (documentation, explanatory texts, etc.) and graphic content (logos, graphic charter, iconographic representations, etc.) offered by AgroPortal are the property of the AgroPortal management and maintenance team. Like the rest of the portal code, they are accessible under Open License.

### Evolution of the Terms & Conditions

These general Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) from their first version in March 2024, must be validated when creating a user account.


These T&Cs may be amended at any time, without notice, depending on modifications made to AgroPortal, changes in legislation or for any other reason deemed necessary by the governance of the AgroPortal repository.


Contributors will be asked to re-accept the conditions of use to continue using AgroPortal, when changes to the T&Cs are applied. Users will also be notified of changes by the user mailing list.

## Privacy policy

### Personal data of contributors

The personal data collected by AgroPortal when creating or having an account are:

* First name, last name, email address;
* ORCID identifier;
* GitHub Login;
* Whether or not to subscribe to the users’ mailing list.

Creating an account results in the creation of a 'login' and an API key allowing to use AgroPortal’s API (with the same rights associated with the user account). The creation of an account is associated with registration on the AgroPortal user mailing list unless the contributor wishes not to be. A contributor can access and modify their information via a dedicated “Account Settings” page. This page is not public and cannot be referenced or identified by external search engines.


The AgroPortal management and maintenance team undertakes to take all necessary measures to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the information of contributors holding an account. This information is never communicated to third parties, except in cases provided for by law. The purpose of these data is the implementation and proper functioning of AgroPortal as well as the processing of requests made via the assistance form. The main purpose of contributor accounts is to allow the posting of ontologies (or content) or access to ontologies (or content) for restricted use. This purpose is linked to the main mission of sharing AgroPortal ontologies. Apart from the software, the recipients of personal data are the members of the AgroPortal management and maintenance team who contribute to the implementation of AgroPortal and the services offered.


AgroPortal may also record and collect information relating to the use of the services by users in its server-side logs. This information is in no way used to track the behavior of a specific user. However, they can be used, in batches, for monitoring and improving the service.


All personal data are stored on AgroPortal servers. The retention period of personal data is:

* Less than a year for data collected in visitor logs.
* For life for information in a contributor's account as long as the account is active. A contributor can nevertheless request the deletion of his account at any time.


As a user, you have a right of access, rectification, opposition for legitimate reasons, limitation and erasure relating to all data concerning you under the conditions provided for by law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to computing, files and freedoms and by the general data protection regulation no. 2016/679. You have the right to give general or specific instructions relating to the conservation, erasure and communication after your death of personal data concerning you in accordance with articles 32-I-6° and 40-1 of the law. of January 6, 1978 amended. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority such as the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL).


You can exercise these rights by contacting the AgroPortal management and maintenance team (with the exception of the right to lodge a complaint which must be exercised directly with a supervisory authority) by email at the contact email address.

### Cookies used by the web application

AgroPortal places audience measurement cookies (number of visits, pages viewed), session identification and local language cookies on users' web browsers. A final cookie is used, once connected to AgroPortal, to store a contributor's APIkey. The session cookie lasts a maximum of one day.


For audience measurements, AgroPortal uses Google Analytics 4 to collect and aggregate this data for the purposes of analysis and monitoring of the platform. This information is in no way used to track the behavior of a specific user. However, they can be used, in batches, for monitoring and improving the service. Google Analytics cookies are:

# **Conditions générales d’utilisation d’AgroPortal (Francais)**

**Dernière mise à jour le 15 mars 2024.**

## **Introduction générale**

De nombreux vocabulaires et ontologies sont produits pour représenter et annoter les données agronomiques. Il est donc nécessaire de disposer d'une plateforme commune pour les identifier, les héberger et permettre leur utilisation automatique dans les applications agro-informatiques. AgroPortal, accessible à l’adresse __<https://agroportal.lirmm.fr>__, est un portail web d'ontologies et de vocabulaires (aka. catalogue d'artefacts sémantiques) dédié aux domaines de l’agronomie, l'agriculture, et l’alimentation. Il offre une application web ainsi qu’une interface programmatique (API) et une interface de requête SPARQL (endpoint). Il s’appuie sur la technologie générique et ouverte OntoPortal (__<https://ontoportal.org>__) qui est spécialisée pour le domaine de l’agriculture. Le portail d'ontologies permet l'hébergement, la recherche, le versionnage, la visualisation, l’exploration, la saisie de commentaires et de propositions pour les ontologies ; il inclut également un  service d’annotation sémantique de texte (Annotator) et un service de recommandation d’ontologies (Recommender) ainsi qu’un catalogue d'alignements entre ontologies (Mapping). Le tout dans une infrastructure entièrement compatible avec le web sémantique. AgroPortal veille tout particulièrement à respecter les exigences de la communauté agronomie, agriculture et alimentation.


Toute utilisation de l'application web AgroPortal, ou de son API ou SPARQL endpoint  est subordonnée au respect des présentes conditions générales d’utilisation (CGU).

**Réutilisation** : Utilisation par toute personne physique ou morale des ontologies ou du contenu d’AgroPortal, y compris à des fins autres que celles pour lesquelles elles ont été produites.

### Droits d’accès

L'utilisation d’AgroPortal est gratuite.


Le contenu d’AgroPortal est par défaut accessible de manière publique et ouvert à tout utilisateur. Pour les ontologies et leur métadonnées, il existe néanmoins trois niveaux de droits d’accès:

* Accès public avec téléchargement du fichier source (et des versions) possibles. C’est le mode activé par défaut.
* Accès public sans téléchargement du fichier source. Ce mode doit être explicitement demandé à un administrateur.
* Accès privé réservé à une sélection de contributeurs déclarée par le dépositaire d’une ontologie ainsi qu’aux curateurs et administrateurs. Cet accès nécessite donc une connexion via un compte utilisateur.

## Objet et fonctionnalités

Le portail AgroPortal permet principalement :

* la découverte, la consultation, la recherche,  la visualisation et le téléchargement d’ontologies et autres contenu par les utilisateurs ;
* la publication d’ontologies ou autres contenus par les contributeurs ;
* la gestion du contenu et du portail par les curateurs et administrateurs.


L’ensemble des fonctionnalités est documentée aux adresses:

* __<https://ontoportal.github.io/documentation/>__
* __<https://doc.jonquetlab.lirmm.fr/share/e6158eda-c109-4385-852c-51a42de9a412/doc/public-documentation-QMpsC9aVBb>__

### Découverte, consultation, recherche, visualisation ou téléchargement d’ontologies et autres contenu par les utilisateurs

AgroPortal met à disposition des ontologies publiées par les contributeurs qui peuvent être accessibles en téléchargement, ou via l'application web, l’API ou le SPARQL endpoint.


La consultation des ontologies et métadonnées mises à disposition en accès public sur AgroPortal ou leur téléchargement ne nécessite aucune connexion ou inscription préalable par les utilisateurs. La consultation et le téléchargement des ontologies publiés en privé nécessitent de s'authentifier. Tout utilisateur est tenu de respecter la licence d’utilisation propre à chaque ontologie. La non création d’un compte utilisateur n’affecte pas la consultation des ressources en accès public sur le portail.


Tout utilisateur peut participer au contrôle de la qualité d’AgroPortal en signalant, à l’adresse email de contact, notamment les contenus n'ayant pas vocation à y figurer (illicites ou contraires aux CGU).

### Publication d’ontologies ou autres contenus par les contributeurs

Tout contributeur peut alimenter le contenu d’AgroPortal entre autres en publiant des ontologies et en les documentant avec des métadonnées. Tout contributeur peut également modifier ou mettre à jour du contenu sur lequel il a les droits (i.e., généralement le contenu préalablement déposé). La suppression de contenu nécessite en général de contacter un administrateur.


Pour devenir contributeur, un utilisateur doit s'inscrire sur AgroPortal en créant un compte nominatif. Pour plus de précisions, sur les comptes utilisateur, voir la rubrique Vie privée des CGU. Après validation automatique du compte, les différentes fonctionnalités sont immédiatement disponibles. Les droits d'administration sur les ontologies autres que celles déposées par un contributeur doivent être attribués par un autre contributeur administrateur de l’ontologie concernée ou par un curateur d‘AgroPortal.

### Gestion du contenu et du portail par les curateurs et administrateurs

Les curateurs et administrateurs sont des utilisateurs associés ou membres de l'équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal. Il sont chargés autant que faire se peut de contrôler la qualité et la cohérence du contenu du portail. Le rôle de curateur ou d'administrateur doit être attribué par un autre curateur ou administrateur de l’équipe de gestion.

## Code de conduite et responsabilités des utilisateurs

AgroPortal  n’a pas vocation à diffuser des données publicitaires, de promotion d’intérêts privés, contrevenant à l’ordre public ou, plus généralement, illicites. Les administrateurs d’AgroPortal sont susceptibles, le cas échéant, sans préavis, de supprimer ou rendre impossible l’accès à de telles données ou contenus.


AgroPortal encourage les contributeurs à fiabiliser et documenter les contenus qu’ils publient. Les contributeurs actualisent leur contenu, conformément à l’article L. 312-1-1 du CRPA.

### Ligne éditoriale

La ligne éditoriale d’AgroPortal concerne le contenu en lien, au sens large, aux domaines de l’agronomie, l’agriculture, l'alimentation et l’environnement. Des ontologies génériques ou des vocabulaires du web sémantique peuvent être aussi hébergés dans un souci de cohérence et de complétude du service aux utilisateurs. Les curateurs sont susceptibles de ne pas accepter d’héberger et de servir des ontologies qui ne seraient pas dans la ligne éditoriale d’AgroPortal. Les utilisateurs et contributeurs sont encouragés à se tourner également vers d’autres acteurs et prestataires de l’Alliance OntoPortal (__<https://ontoportal.org>__) qui peuvent fournir des portails d’ontologies similaires avec d’autres lignes éditoriales.

### Données à caractère personnel

Les ontologies et autres contenus hébergés sur AgroPortal ne sont pas censés contenir des données à caractère personnel. Seuls les comptes nominatifs contiennent des données à caractère personnel (Voir Vie privée).

### Données couvertes par des droits de propriété intellectuelle

Les contributeurs sont seuls responsables des ontologies ou contenus qu’ils publient sur AgroPortal.


Lorsque un contributeur publie une ontologie comprenant des droits de propriété intellectuelle qui peuvent faire obstacle à sa réutilisation, il doit mentionner ces droits dans la métadonnées de l’ontologie. Il doit alors indiquer l’identité de la personne physique ou morale titulaire de ces droits ou, si celle-ci n’est pas connue, l’identité de la personne auprès de laquelle l’ontologie concernée a été obtenue.


Quand des contributeurs déposent une ontologie, il est préférable qu'ils soient eux-mêmes des auteurs développeurs ou contributeurs de cette ontologie. Dans le cas contraire, les curateurs d’AgroPortal sont susceptibles de ne pas accepter d’héberger et de servir une ontologie déposée par un non-auteur et pour laquelle AgroPortal aurait reçu une requête de retrait d’un auteur ou développeur original de l’ontologie concernée.

### Licences

Nous distinguons la license qui s’applique sur une ontologie hébergée de la license qui s’applique sur les métadonnées de cette ontologie décrites dans l’entrée du catalogue d’AgroPortal.

* La licence de l’ontologie est renseignée, autant que faire se peut, par le contributeur dans la métadonnée. Elle doit être en accord avec le niveau d’accessibilité choisie par le contributeur pour cette ontologie. En l’absence de licence explicitement renseignée, une ontologie accessible publiquement sur AgroPortal est considérée par défaut comme publique et réutilisable et diffusée sous Licence Ouverte (équivalent à CC-BY).
* La licence qui s’applique aux métadonnées des ontologies (accessibles  publiquement et privées) et décrites dans l’entrée du catalogue d’AgroPortal est une Licence Ouverte (équivalent à CC-BY). Dans le cas des ontologies privées, AgroPortal s’engage à ne pas diffuser cette information tant que le droit d’accès de l’ontologie n’est pas changé pour être “public”.


Les ontologies comportant des informations non publiques sont diffusées, le cas échéant seulement après accord du tiers titulaire ou cotitulaire de droits.

### Adresse email de contact

L’adresse email de contact de l'équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal est __[agroportal-support@lirmm.fr](mailto:agroportal-support@lirmm.fr)__


Elle permet de contacter les administrateurs d’AgroPortal pour obtenir de l’aide ou des informations sur l’usage du portail ou de son contenu. Elle n’a pas pour objet de recevoir des demandes relatives à la situation individuelle d’un utilisateur  dans ses relations avec une autorité administrative. Elle n’est pas non plus un moyen direct de contacter un contributeur ; les utilisateurs peuvent pour cela se tourner vers les informations de contact renseignées dans la métadonnées des ontologies.

### Liste de diffusion des utilisateurs

L’adresse email de la liste de diffusion des utilisateurs et contributeurs d’AgroPortal est __[agroportal-users@lirmm.fr](mailto:agroportal-users@lirmm.fr)__


Elle permet à l’équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal de contacter les contributeurs ou autres utilisateurs pour les informer de nouvelles fonctionnalités, informations ou toutes autres nouvelles en lien avec l’usage d’AgroPortal. Elle n’a pas pour objet la diffusion de message en dehors du sujet d’AgroPortal. Elle n’est pas non plus un moyen direct d’échange entre contributeurs ou utilisateurs.


La création d’un compte utilisateur sur AgroPortal est associée à l’inscription automatique sur la liste de diffusion des utilisateurs. Toute personne peut demander à tout moment son retrait de ladite liste de diffusion via l’adresse email de contact.

## Engagements et responsabilités

### Qualité de service et facilités offertes

Sous réserve des dispositions du paragraphe suivant, l'équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal s’efforce de garantir la disponibilité et la robustesse des services d’AgroPortal. Cela s’applique à l’ensemble du logiciel AgroPortal, qu’il soit accéder par son application web, son API ou son SPARQL endpoint.


Toutefois, l'équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal se réserve également la liberté de faire évoluer, de modifier ou de suspendre, sans préavis, le portail AgroPortal pour des raisons de maintenance ou pour tout autre motif qu'elle juge nécessaire. L’indisponibilité d’AgroPortal ne donne droit à aucune indemnité et ne peut donner lieu à aucune poursuite.


AgroPortal s’engage à prendre toutes précautions utiles pour préserver l’intégrité des ontologies mises à disposition, et notamment empêcher que leur contenu ne soit déformé ou assujetti à une interprétation spécifique. AgroPortal s’engage à suivre, tant que faire se peut, les standards de la communauté du web sémantique et en particulier les Recommandations du W3C.


À la seule fin de garantir un meilleur service aux utilisateurs, et sans jamais en dénaturer le sens ou la valeur, les curateurs se réservent la possibilité de modifier les métadonnées associées à une ontologie.

### Responsabilités d’AgroPortal

L'équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal n’effectue pas de contrôle a priori sur le contenu des contributeurs. Dès que AgroPortal a connaissance de contenus illicites ou ne respectant pas les CGUs, les administrateurs d’AgroPortal agissent rapidement pour retirer ce contenu ou en rendre l’accès impossible. Une procédure de “Retours utilisateur” est mise en place sur AgroPortal et peu être utilisée pour signaler un contenu non conforme aux CGUs.


AgroPortal se réserve notamment la possibilité de supprimer ou de rendre inaccessibles, sans préavis :

* Les contributions sans lien avec l’activité du portail (voir Ligne éditoriale), publiées aux fins d’entraver le bon fonctionnement, de publicité ou de promotion, de propagande ou de prosélytisme et toute contribution contrevenant aux lois et règlements en vigueur;
* Le compte personnel d’un contributeur, curateur ou administrateur et de refuser que certaines personnes aient accès au portail en cas de violation des CGUs.

### Contenu textuel et graphique

Les contenus textuels (documentation, textes d’explication, etc.) et graphiques (logos, charte graphique, représentations iconographiques, etc.) proposés par AgroPortal sont la propriété de l’équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal. Comme le reste du code du portail, ils sont accessibles sous Licence Ouverte.

### Évolution des conditions générales d’utilisation

Ces conditions générales d’utilisation (CGUs) à partir de leur première version en Mars 2024, doivent être validées lors de la création d’un compte utilisateur.


Les termes des présentes CGUs peuvent être amendés à tout moment, sans préavis, en fonction des modifications apportées à AgroPortal, de l’évolution de la législation ou pour tout autre motif jugé nécessaire par la gouvernance du portail AgroPortal.


Le contributeur sera invité à accepter de nouveau les conditions d’utilisation pour continuer à utiliser AgroPortal, lorsque des évolutions des CGU sont appliquées. Les utilisateurs seront également avertis des modifications par la liste de diffusion utilisateur.

## Vie privée

### Données à caractère personnel des contributeurs

Les données à caractère personnel recueillies par le AgroPortal lors de la création ou possession d’un compte sont les suivantes:

* Prénom, nom, adresse email;
* Identifiant ORCID;
* Login GitHub;
* Inscription ou non sur la liste de diffusion des utilisateurs.

La création d’un compte donne lieu à la création d’un ‘login’ et d'une clé’ d’API (APIkey) qui permet d’utiliser l’API d’AgroPortal (avec les mêmes droits associés au compte utilisateur). La création d’un compte est associée à l’inscription sur la liste de diffusions utilisateurs d’AgroPortal sauf si le contributeur souhaite ne pas l’être. Un contributeur peut accéder et modifier les informations le concernant via une page dédiée “Paramètres du compte”. Cette page n'est pas publique et ne peut pas être référencée ou identifiée par des moteurs de recherches externes.


L’équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal s'engage à prendre toutes les mesures nécessaires permettant de garantir la sécurité et la confidentialité des informations des contributeurs titulaires d’un compte. Ces informations ne sont jamais communiquées à des tiers, en dehors des cas prévus par la loi. Ces données ont pour finalité la mise en œuvre et le bon fonctionnement du portail AgroPortal ainsi que le traitement des demandes effectuées via le formulaire d'assistance. Les comptes des contributeurs ont pour principale finalité de permettre de déposer des ontologies (ou du contenu) ou d’accéder à des ontologies (ou du contenu) à usage restreint. Cette finalité est liée à la mission principale de partage des ontologies d’AgroPortal. Hormis le logiciel, les destinataires des données à caractère personnel sont les membres de l’équipe de gestion et maintenance d’AgroPortal qui concourent à la mise en œuvre du portail AgroPortal et des services qui y sont proposés.


AgroPortal peut également enregistrer et collecter des informations relatives à l’usage des services par les utilisateurs dans ses logs côté serveur. Ces informations ne sont en aucun cas utilisées pour tracer le comportement d’un utilisateur spécifique. Cependant, elles peuvent être utilisées, en lot, pour le suivi et l’amélioration du service.


Toutes les données à caractère personnel sont stockées sur les serveurs d’AgroPortal. La durée de conservation des données à caractère personnel est de :

* Moins de deux ans pour les données collectées dans les logs visiteurs.
* A vie pour les informations d’un compte d’un contributeur tant que le compte est actif. Un contributeur peut néanmoins demander à tout moment la suppression de son compte.


En tant qu’utilisateur, vous disposez d’un droit d’accès, de rectification, d’opposition pour motifs légitimes, de limitation et d’effacement relativement à l’ensemble des données vous concernant dans les conditions prévues par la loi n°78-17 du 6 janvier 1978 relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés et par le règlement général relatif à la protection des données n° 2016/679. Vous disposez du droit de donner des directives générales ou particulières relatives à la conservation, à l'effacement et à la communication après votre décès des données à caractère personnel vous concernant conformément aux articles 32-I-6° et 40-1 de la loi du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée. Vous disposez par ailleurs du droit d’introduire une réclamation auprès d’une autorité de contrôle telle que la Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL).


Vous pouvez exercer ces droits en vous adressant à l’équipe de gestion et de maintenance d’AgroPortal (à l’exception du droit d’introduire une réclamation qui doit être exercé directement auprès d’une autorité de contrôle) par email l’adresse email de contact.

### Cookies utilisés par l’application web

AgroPortal dépose des cookies de mesure d’audience (nombre de visites, pages consultées), d’identification de session et de langue locale sur le navigateur Web des des utilisateurs. Un dernier cookie est utilisé, un fois connecté à AgroPortal, pour stocker l’APIkey d’un contributeur. Le cookie de session à une durée maximale d’une journée.


Pour les mesures d’audience, AgroPortal utilise Google Analytics 4 pour rassembler et agréger ces données dans un but d’analyse et de suivi de la plateforme. Ces informations ne sont en aucun cas utilisées pour tracer le comportement d’un utilisateur spécifique. Cependant, elles peuvent être utilisées, en lot, pour le suivi et l’amélioration du service. Les cookies de Google Analytics sont:

* _ga : Ce cookie est utilisé pour distinguer les utilisateurs uniques en attribuant un numéro généré aléatoirement comme identifiant client. Il expire généralement au bout de 2 ans.
* _gid : ce cookie est utilisé pour distinguer les utilisateurs et est défini par Google Analytics pour stocker et mettre à jour une valeur unique pour chaque page visitée. Il expire généralement après 24 heures.
* _gat : ce cookie est utilisé pour limiter le taux de requêtes et limite la collecte de données sur les sites à fort trafic. Il expire après 1 minute.
